## About

[GR-Athena++](https://github.com/computationalrelativity/grathena) is a scalable code for 3+1 numerical relativity refactored from the [Athena++](https://www.athena-astro.app/index.html) magnetohydrodynamics code and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework. The new main features of the code are

 * Support for [vertex-centered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08289) and [cell-centered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09139) spacetime variables;
 * Dynamical spacetime solver based on the [Z4c](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2920) formulation of 3+1 general relativity and high-order operators;
 * GRMHD solver on dynamical spacetimes based on the conservative 3+1 Eulerian "Valencia" formulation and Athena++ constrained transport algorithm;
 * Radiation transport solver on dynamical spacetimes based on the [M1 formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14858);
 * Support for various equations of state, including tabular microphysical models;
 * Adaptive mesh refinement algorithms for black hole evolutions in the puncture framework;
 * Gravitational-wave extraction and output for Cauchy Characteristic evolution;
 * Apparent horizon finder based on [fast flow algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9707050).

GR-Athena++ is developed by the [Computational Relativity (CoRe)](http://www.computational-relativity.org) collaboration at Jena (Germany) and Penn State (USA).
